#### Student Name: Adam Gibbons   Student ID: 20095362

TODO: Write a short project description.

The WeatherTop IoT platform is a fully developed iteration of the platform that enables users to add their own locations, and through MQTT subscriptions they can add any number of subscriptions from any publicly accessible MQTT broker. These subscriptions are then tracked and the data stored, including fully live updates through the means of MQTT websocket client connection.

Further, the platform has an area for tracking network devices, should the user wish to also publish this data to provide info on their local network. 

Stretch Goals:
-------------
 - Provide charting for historical data
 - Allow "on/off" type subscriptions to be published back to
 - Provide a means to create actionable "rules" e.g. if <SENSOR> is false && <MAC_ADDRESS> is online then email user
